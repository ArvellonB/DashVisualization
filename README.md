Dynamic Data Dashboard(DashVisualization)
Overview
Welcome to Dynamic Data Dashboard! This project is a simple web application that I built with Dash that lets users create and interact with data visualizations. Whether you have a small dataset or just want to see your data in a new light, this tool makes it easy to turn your data into meaningful insights.

Features
Interactive Dashboards: Upload your data, and the app generates interactive visualizations on the fly.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple, clean design for ease of use.
Line Charts: View your data trends over time with line charts.

You should see the dashboard where you can interact with the data visualizations.

Code Explanation
Here's a brief rundown of the main code components:

src/app.py: This is the main script that initializes the Dash app, loads the sample data, and sets up the layout. It uses Plotly to create a line chart from the data.

src/data/sample_data.csv: A sample CSV file containing date and value columns used to populate the chart.

Code Breakdown
Initialize Dash App: app = dash.Dash(__name__) sets up the Dash app.

Load Data: df = pd.read_csv('src/data/sample_data.csv') reads the CSV file into a DataFrame.

Create Chart: fig = px.line(df, x='Date', y='Value', title='Sample Data Visualization') generates a line chart using Plotly.

App Layout: Defines the structure of the web page, including the chart and title.
